    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Chinese-inspired fried rice recipe is my absolute fave. It’s quick and easy to make, customizable 
        with any of your favorite mix-ins, and so irresistibly delicious.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>Cooked, chilled rice</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Carrots</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Soy sauce</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Use cold rice: You’ve gotta plan ahead and use thoroughly-chilled cooked rice. A fresh batch of 
            warm (or even lukewarm) rice will not fry well when it hits the hot pan, and will result in soggy 
            and sticky clumps — no good. So leftover refrigerated rice is ideal! </li>
        <li>Use butter: Yes, butter. I have made many a batch of fried rice using various oils, and I’m now 
            convinced there’s a reason why Japanese steak houses use that big slab of butter when they’re making 
            fried rice.</li>
        <li>Use veggies: This is one of my big pet peeves with lame take-out fried rice — not enough veggies!</li>
    </ol>
